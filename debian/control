Description: a high-performance memory object caching system
    HybridStore is a fast, distributed, highly-scalable, fault-tolerant,
    semi-persistent object caching system designed to increase application
    performance by storing (in memory) objects that would otherwise require
    significant time or resources to generate. Since applications are often
    limited by database performance, the result of limiting database queries is
    better application performance.
    HybridStore is implemented such that each instance (possibly on the same
    machine) in a cluster maintains a red-black tree of objects allocated by
    key. Thus, in the case of single-instance failure, most of the cluster's
    objects remain intact.
    Designed with scalability in mind, HybridStore uses libev and non-blocking
    I/O to support many simultaneous connections.
